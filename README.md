# Password-breaker---3171
A python project that can crack a password for a web form login, uses Kali Linux
Looking into Kivy for the GUI or Tkinter

- We first will try to create a program that will crack a locked file
- A program that will crack a password (and username) for a web form.
- We will create a website with a simple login and welcome screen.
- We will have a database that will store usernames and passwords
- We will use Python to code the project and create a GUI interface

EXTRA:
